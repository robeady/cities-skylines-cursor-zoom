Build

I didn't want to install visual studio, so this project has a hacked together sln+csproj file that may not work perfectly in VS.

Find a sufficiently new version of MSBuild.exe and run `MSBuild` from this directory.

This will also copy the mod to the local Cities Skylines mods folder (under appdata) for hot reloading
